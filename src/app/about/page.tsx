                This started as a way to organize the memes I kept sending to friends. Then it became a way to 
                organize the memes friends kept sending to me. Now it&apos;s just a place where memes go to get organized, 
                I guess. I&apos;m not sure when it got out of hand.

                I&apos;m mostly resharing stuff I find or that friends send me. Just a guy who likes organizing things in a way that doesn&apos;t make sense.

                The meme generator? That was born from pure spite. I was using some random meme page and couldn&apos;t do any of the basic stuff, 
                and then someone told me &quot;you can&apos;t make a meme generator that&apos;s actually usable&quot; and I took that personally. And he was kinda right.

                Built with Next.js, React, and enough caffeine to power a small city. Also, I may have talked to 
                my 2 dogs and a cat while debugging.

                To everyone who uses this site: you&apos;re the reason I can tell my family I&apos;m &quot;working&quot; 
                instead of just &quot;messing around on the internet.&quot; Also, you&apos;re the reason I keep finding 
                new bugs to fix at 2 AM. So... thanks? I think?
              </p>
              <p>
                Your support really means so much to me. I&apos;m genuinely thankful to all the people who have supported me 
                and who will continue to support this ridiculous project. It&apos;s amazing to see people actually using 
                something I built, even if it&apos;s just for organizing and creating memes. Thanks again, from the bottom of my heart.
              </p>
              <p>
                Shoutout to the actual meme creators, the developers who inspired me, my pets and my family who has no idea what I do.
